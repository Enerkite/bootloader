# I2C Bootloader Tools Help

- Refer to [Binary to C Array script help](../../../../../tools/docs/readme_btl_bin_to_c_array.md) to convert the binary file to a C style array containing Hex output. The I2C bootloader host device can store this in its NVM and then send it to I2C bootloader running on target device.

- Refer to [Bootloader and Application binary merge script Help](../../../../../tools/docs/readme_btl_app_merge_bin.md) for merging the bootloader and application binary.
