- **Bootloader NVM Memory Used:**
    - Specifies the memory peripheral used by bootloader to perform flash operations
    - The name of the peripheral will vary from device to device

- **Bootloader Size (Bytes):**
    - Specifies the maximum size of flash required by the bootloader
    - This size is calculated based on Bootloader type and Memory used
    - This size will vary from device to device and should always be aligned to device erase unit size

- **Enable Bootloader Trigger From Firmware: (Basic Mode Only)**
    - This Option can be used to Force Trigger bootloader from application firmware after a soft reset. It does so by reserving the specified number of bytes in SRAM from the start of the RAM. The reserved memory is updated by the application with a pre-defined pattern. The bootloader firmware in the [bootloader_Trigger()](./usb_bootloader_library_interface.md#bootloader_trigger) routine, can check the reserved memory for the pre-defined pattern and enter bootloader mode if the pattern matches.

    - **Number Of Bytes To Reserve From Start Of RAM:**
        - This option adds the provided offset to RAM Start address in bootloader linker script.
        - Application firmware can store some pattern in the reserved bytes region from RAM start for bootloader to check at reset in [bootloader_Trigger()](./usb_bootloader_library_interface.md#bootloader_trigger) function

- **Use Dual Bank For Live Update:**
    - Used to configure bootloader library to use Inactive bank of the device to upload the new application
    - This option is visible only for devices supporting Dual flash banks

    - **Live Update Flash Bank Size (Bytes):**
        - Specifies the size of bank in which both the bootloader and application code reside. Thisvalue by default will be half of the available Flash memory
    - **Trigger Reset After Update:**
        - This option can be used to trigger a **Swap bank and reset** immediatly after programming the application in inactive bank.
        - If not enabled, then the application code should call the [bootloader_SwapAndReset()](./usb_bootloader_library_interface.md#bootloader_swapandreset) function to  trigger **Swap bank and reset**

## USB Device HID Driver Configurations

<p align="center">
    <img src = "./images/usb_bootloader_mhc_config_usb_driver.png"/>
</p>

- **Vendor ID:** 0x04D8
- **Product Id Selection:** usb_device_hid_bootloader
- **Product ID:** 0x003C
    - To be used to configure Unified Host Application
- **Product String Selection:** USB HID Bootloader


## Bootloader System Configurations (Basic Mode Only)

<p align="center">
    <img src = "./images/usb_bootloader_mhc_config_basic_system.png"/>
</p>

- **Application Start Address (Hex):**
    - Start address of the application which will programmed by bootloader
    - This value is filled by bootloader when its loaded which is equal to the bootloader size. It can be modified as per user need
    - This value will be used by bootloader to Jump to application at device reset

## Bootloader Linker Pre Processor Macros for CORTEX-M based MCUs

- Based on the configurations the above linker pre processor macros will be generated in MPLAB X xc32-ld settings
    - ROM_LENGTH specifies the size of the bootloader

### Basic Mode
