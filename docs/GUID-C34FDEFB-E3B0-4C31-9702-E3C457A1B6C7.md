# UART Bootloader system level execution flow

**Basic Bootloader system level execution flow**

-   The Bootloader code starts executing on a device Reset

-   If there are no conditions to enter the firmware upgrade mode, the Bootloader starts executing the user application

    -   Refer to **Bootloader Trigger Methods** for different conditions to enter firmware upgrade mode

-   The Bootloader performs Flash erase/program operations while in the firmware upgrade mode

**Fail Safe Update Bootloader system level execution flow \(MIPS Based MCUs\)**

-   Bootloader always maps **Bank 1 to lower region** at boot up irrespective of cause for reset **\(Hard/Soft\)**.

    -   This is required because if **Swap bit was set** and a **soft reset** was triggered the **value is retained** but if **Swap bit was set** and **Hard reset** was triggered the **value is cleared**

-   Once Swap bit is cleared and Bank 1 is mapped to lower region it performs below operation

    -   If **Bank 1 serial number is greater** than Bank 2 serial number it just continues for trigger check or runs application from Bank 1, As Bank 1 is already mapped to lower region in above step **\(Bank 1 is Active Bank\)**

    -   If **Bank 2 serial number is greater** than Bank 1 serial number it **maps Bank 2 to lower region** by setting the Swap bit and proceeds to trigger check or runs application from Bank 2 **\(Bank 2 is Active Bank\)**

-   Whenever Bootlader programs new application in the **Inactive bank** and **swap bank** command is received it reads the serial number from Active bank, increments by 1 and then writes to Inactive Bank serial

    -   **Inactive Bank Serial number = Active Bank serial number + 1**

    -   Start address of inactive bank is equal start of mid of flash

-   **If the Host application requests to update the Active Bank and the address falls into the active bank serial sector it sends an error response and aborts the programming operation**
