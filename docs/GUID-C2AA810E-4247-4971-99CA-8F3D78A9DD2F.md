# Basic Memory layout for MIPS based MCUs

**Bootloader placement for various PIC32M product families**

The bootloader is placed in **Boot Flash Memory \(BFM\)** or **Program Flash Memory \(PFM\)** based on the size of the bootloader and available Boot flash memory on the device.

-   If the bootloader fits into the available BFM, it is placed in BFM. The user application can use the complete area of the program Flash memory.

-   If the bootloader does not fit into the available BFM, its **reset handler** is placed in BFM and rest of code is placed in PFM. The user application can use the remaining area of the program Flash memory.

-   The following table shows the available Boot Flash memory and the placement of different bootloaders by product family.


**Note:**

The Boot Flash and Program Flash memory end addresses may vary from device to device. Refer to respective Data sheets for details of Flash memory layout.
