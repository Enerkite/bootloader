**Setting up the Host PC**

-   The Script is compatible with **Python 3.x** and higher


**Description**

-   This script should be used to convert the binary file to a C style array containing Hex output that can be directly included in target application code

-   It is mainly used when programming the application using the **host\_app\_nvm application in I2C/CAN Bootloader**

-   If size of the input binary file is not aligned to device erase boundary it appends 0xFF to the binary to make it aligned and then generates the Hex output

-   User must specify the binary file to convert \(-b\), hex output file \(-o\) and the device \(-d\)
