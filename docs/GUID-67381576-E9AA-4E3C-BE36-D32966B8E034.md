# CAN Bootloader

The CAN bootloader Library can be used to upgrade firmware on a target device without the need for an external programmer or debugger.

**Features**

-   Supported on CORTEX-M based MCUs

-   Uses Harmony 3 CAN PLIB to communicate resulting in **smaller bootloader size**

-   Supports Fail Safe update

-   Takes **Binary File** as input

-   Receives Binary from an **C Embedded Host Device**


**Running From SRAM \(For SAM Devices\)**

-   Has capability to self update as it is running from SRAM

-   At reset the bootloader Reset handler copies the entire bootloader firmware into SRAM from Start location and start executing from SRAM

-   Once the application is called from bootloader, applications startup code takes control over SRAM and starts executing

-   **Input Task:**

    -   This task is responsible for receiving data from Embedded Host through the CAN interface

    -   The task keeps polling for data to be received when bootloader is in idle mode

    -   Once the packet reception is completed it gives control to **Command Task**

-   **Command Task:**

    -   The task first validates the incoming packet from host with expected header information

    -   The task processes the commands received from **Input Task** and provides response back to host accordingly

    -   If the command received is a **Data command** it gives control to the **Flash Task**

-   **Flash Task:**

    -   This task is responsible to program the internal flash memory with data packet received

    -   The task uses the NVM peripheral library to perform the Unlock/Erase/Write Operations
