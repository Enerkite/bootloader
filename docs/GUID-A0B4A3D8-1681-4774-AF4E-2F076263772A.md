# Serial Memory Bootloader execution flow

-   On device reset after systme initialize, The Bootloader task starts executing from the SYS\_Tasks\(\)

-   Once the Serial Memory driver is ready, it retrieves the **Meta Data** from serial memory

    -   If any error in reading the Meta-Data it directly jumps Run application

-   It checks if the Meta Data read is valid using the **Prologue and Epilogue**.

    -   **If valid**

        -   It stores the application start address and application size from meta data which will be used during programming operation

        -   Checks if the **Update Required flag** is set. If set it jumps to Programming step **Or** continues to Trigger Check

    -   **If Invalid**

        -   It continues to Trigger Check


**Trigger Check**

-   If there are no conditions to enter the firmware upgrade mode, the Bootloader jumps to Run application

    -   Refer to Bootloader Trigger Methods for different conditions to enter firmware upgrade mode


**Programming**

-   Starts reading the application binary from serial memory and perform erase/program operations on internal flash

-   Once programming is completed, it generates CRC32 on programmed space of internal flash and verifies it against the CRC32 value stored in Meta data

-   Once verification is complete it clears the **update required flag** in meta data and triggers reset to Run application


**Run Application**

-   The application start address used to jump to application space can be

    -   Application start address generated during compile time **Or**

    -   Application start address retrieved from **valid Meta Data**

-   Calls **SYS\_DeInitialize\(\)** function to release resources used

-   Jumps to application space to run the updated application
