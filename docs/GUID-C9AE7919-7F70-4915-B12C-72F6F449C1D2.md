For Live Update Bootloader

-   **Bootloader NVM Memory Used:**

    -   Specifies the memory peripheral used by bootloader to perform flash operations

    -   The name of the peripheral will vary from device to device

-   **Bootloader Size \(Bytes\):**

    -   Specifies the maximum size of flash required by the bootloader

    -   This size is calculated based on Bootloader type and Memory used

    -   This size will vary from device to device and should always be aligned to device erase unit size

-   **Enable Bootloader Trigger From Firmware: \(Basic Mode Only\)**

    -   This Option can be used to Force Trigger bootloader from application firmware after a soft reset. It does so by reserving the specified number of bytes in SRAM from the start of the RAM. The reserved memory is updated by the application with a pre-defined pattern. The bootloader firmware in the bootloader\_Trigger\(\) routine, can check the reserved memory for the pre-defined pattern and enter bootloader mode if the pattern matches.

    -   **Number Of Bytes To Reserve From Start Of RAM:**

        -   This option adds the provided offset to RAM Start address in bootloader linker script.

        -   Application firmware can store some pattern in the reserved bytes region from RAM start for bootloader to check at reset in bootloader\_Trigger\(\) function

-   **Use Dual Bank For Live Update:**

    -   Used to configure bootloader library to use Inactive bank of the device to upload the new application

    -   This option is visible only for devices supporting Dual flash banks

    -   **Live Update Flash Bank Size \(Bytes\):**

        -   Specifies the size of bank in which both the bootloader and application code reside. Thisvalue by default will be half of the available Flash memory

    -   **Trigger Reset After Update:**

        -   This option can be used to trigger a **Swap bank and reset** immediatly after programming the application in inactive bank.

        -   If not enabled, then the application code should call the bootloader\_SwapAndReset\(\) function to trigger **Swap bank and reset**


**USB Device HID Driver Configurations**

![usb_bootloader_mhc_config_usb_driver](GUID-9B7CF54C-66CE-445B-914B-E0530F384A24-low.png)

-   **Vendor ID:** 0x04D8

-   **Product Id Selection:** usb\_device\_hid\_bootloader

-   **Product ID:** 0x003C

    -   To be used to configure Unified Host Application

-   **Product String Selection:** USB HID Bootloader


**Bootloader System Configurations \(Basic Mode Only\)**

![usb_bootloader_mhc_config_basic_system](GUID-DD5AA647-8D51-4857-AAF5-717A3FDFB785-low.png)

-   **Application Start Address \(Hex\):**

    -   Start address of the application which will programmed by bootloader

    -   This value is filled by bootloader when its loaded which is equal to the bootloader size. It can be modified as per user need

    -   This value will be used by bootloader to Jump to application at device reset


**Bootloader Linker Pre Processor Macros for CORTEX-M based MCUs**

-   Based on the configurations the above linker pre processor macros will be generated in MPLAB X xc32-ld settings

    -   ROM\_LENGTH specifies the size of the bootloader
