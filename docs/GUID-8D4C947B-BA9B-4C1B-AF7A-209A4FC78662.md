**Using Unified Host Tool in debugging mode**

-   **On Windows:**

    -   Launch Windows Command prompt in **tools/UnifiedHost-\*/** directory

    -   Run below command to launch Unified Host Application in debugging mode

        ```c
        java -Djava.util.logging.config.file="logging.properties" -jar UnifiedHost-*.jar
        ```

-   **On Linux**

    -   For running Unified Host tool in debug mode on linux make use of MPLAB X's Java JRE

    -   Launch Linux Command prompt in **tools/UnifiedHost-\*/** directory

    -   Run below command to launch Unified Host Application in debugging mode

        ```c
        /opt/microchip/mplabx/<MPLAB X Version>/sys/java/zulu8.40.0.25-ca-fx-jre8.0.222-linux_x64/bin/java -Djava.util.logging.config.file="logging.properties" -jar UnifiedHost-*.jar
        ```

-   Once the tool is launched refer to steps mentioned above in Configuring and Using the Unified Host tool to program application hex

-   You can see the logs during programming sequence on the command prompt

-   Once done you can open the **tools/UnifiedHost-\*/app.log** file and check for the programming sequence logs
