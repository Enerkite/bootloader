# Live Update Memory layout for MIPS based MCUs

-   Supported for the devices which have a Dual Bank flash memory

-   **Switcher code** is placed at start of the Boot flash memory \(0xBFC00000\) as upon reset the device runs from start of boot flash memory.

    -   **Note: The switcher code provided does not have any programming capabilities.It just performs bank swap operations**

-   Device always executes the application firmware from PFM bank mapped to lower memory region **\(0x1D00\_0000 Physical address\)**

    -   Start address of Active Bank is mapped to lower region **0x9D000000**

    -   Start address of Inactive Bank is from mid of the PFM which can vary from device to device. Refer to respective Data sheets for details of Flash memory layout.

-   Row size number of bytes are reserved at end of each bank for storing serial number. This serial number will be used by the **switcher code placed in BFM** to map the appropriate PFM bank to lower memory region and run the application from there

-   **Volatile register SWAP bit** is used to map either of bank to lower memory region by switcher

-   The bootloader live update code responsible to program the inactive bank is part of the application it self. Which means the programming operation can happen while the application is running

    -   **Live Update Application = \(Bootloader Code in Live Update mode + Application code\)**

-   The application code is responsible to send a request to bootloader live update code to perform a **bank swap and reset** to run the new firmware programmed in Inactive bank

-   Once this request is received the bootloader live update code performs below operation before initiating a reset to run new firmware

    -   **Inactive Serial number = Active serial number + 1**

-   At reset switcher first maps Bank 1 to lower region and reads the serial numbers from both banks

-   If Bank 2 serial number is greater than Bank 1 serial number, it maps Bank 2 to lower region by setting the Swap bit and runs the new firmware. **Now Bank 2 is Active bank**

-   The live update start address should always fall into lower mapped region **\(0x9D000000 to Mid of Flash\)**. Size of the application in the linker script should also not exceed the Mid of flash.
