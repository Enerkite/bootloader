# CAN Bootloader Firmware Update mode execution flow

**Bootloader Task Flow**

-   Bootloader task is the main task which calls the Input sub-tasks in a forever loop.

-   It calls the Input task to poll for command packets from host

-   Once complete packet is received **Input Task** calls **Command task** to process the received command

-   If the command received was a data command **Command task** calls **Flash Task** to flash the application

**Input Task Flow**

-   This task is used to receive the data bytes from embedded host

-   The task keeps polling for data to be received when bootloader is in idle mode

-   Once the packet reception is completed it gives control to **Command Task**

**Command Task Flow**

-   The task first validates the incoming packet from host with expected header information

-   The task processes the commands received from **Input Task** and provides response back to host accordingly

-   If the command received is a **Data command** it gives control to the **Flash Task**

**Flash Task Flow**

-   This task is responsible to program the internal flash memory with data packet received

-   The task uses the NVM peripheral library to perform the Unlock/Erase/Write Operations
