**Bootloader Specific User Configurations**

For devices with Dual Bank support and No Data Cache

For devices with No Dual Bank support and Data Cache

![can_bootloader_mhc_config_sam_with_cache](GUID-6AFCD28C-2F76-4ED9-BA1A-4CD7C27037C2-low.png)

-   **Bootloader Peripheral Used:**

    -   Specifies the communication peripheral used by bootloader to receive the application

    -   The name of the peripheral will vary from device to device

-   **Bootloader NVM Memory Used:**

    -   Specifies the memory peripheral used by bootloader to perform flash operations

    -   The name of the peripheral will vary from device to device

-   **Bootloader Size \(Bytes\):**

    -   Specifies the maximum size of flash required by the bootloader

    -   This size is calculated based on Bootloader type and Memory used

    -   This size will vary from device to device and should always be aligned to device erase unit size

-   **Enable Bootloader Trigger From Firmware:**

    -   This Option can be used to Force Trigger bootloader from application firmware after a soft reset. It does so by reserving the specified number of bytes in SRAM from the start of the RAM. The reserved memory is updated by the application with a pre-defined pattern. The bootloader firmware in the [bootloader\_Trigger\(\)](can_bootloader_library_interface.md#) routine, can check the reserved memory for the pre-defined pattern and enter bootloader mode if the pattern matches.

    -   **Number Of Bytes To Reserve From Start Of RAM:**

        -   This option adds the provided offset to RAM Start address in bootloader linker script.

        -   Application firmware can store some pattern in the reserved bytes region from RAM start for bootloader to check at reset in [bootloader\_Trigger\(\)](can_bootloader_library_interface.md#) function

-   **Use Dual Bank For Safe Flash Update:**

    -   Used to configure bootloader to use Dual banks of device to upload the application

    -   This option is visible only for devices supporting Dual flash banks

-   **Select MPU Region to configure non-cacheable memory:**

    -   Used to select the MPU region for which he SRAM has been configured as non-cahceable space

    -   Configure the region selected above in MPU settings of MHC as shown in [Bootloader MPU Configurations](#bootloader-mpu-configurations)

    -   A seperate section will be created for this region in the custom linker script generated for bootloader

    -   This option is visible only for devices which have Data cache.


**Bootloader MPU Configurations**

-   Open MPU settings from MHC-\>Tools option. Select **Enable MPU**

-   Configure the region selected in Bootloader component as **ram\_nocache** with other parameters as shown

Bootloader Linker code for ram\_nochache

-   For CAN bootloader below **xxx\_message\_ram** section will be added to the custom linker file generated

    -   **Note: xxx should be replaced with the CAN PLIB being used.**

    -   Example: **MCAN1**


```c
MEMORY
{
  rom (rx) : ORIGIN = ROM_START, LENGTH = ROM_SIZE
  ram (rwx) : ORIGIN = RAM_START, LENGTH = RAM_SIZE

  /* The address mentioned here should match with address mentioned in MPU settings */
  ram_nocache (RWX) : ORIGIN = 0x2045f000, LENGTH = (1 << (11 + 1))

}

...
...

.mcan1_message_ram (NOLOAD):
{
    . = ALIGN(4);
    _s_mcan1_message_ram = .;
    *(.mcan1_message_ram)
    . = ALIGN(4);
    _e_mcan1_message_ram = .;
} > ram_nocache

...

```

-   CAN Bootloader will use this section to to allocate **MCAN Message RAM configuration in contiguous non-cacheable buffer**


```c
static uint8_t CACHE_ALIGN __attribute__((space(data), section (".mcan1_message_ram"))) mcan1MessageRAM[MCAN1_MESSAGE_RAM_CONFIG_SIZE];

/* Set MCAN1 Message RAM Configuration */
MCAN1_MessageRAMConfigSet(mcan1MessageRAM);

```

**Bootloader System Configurations**

![can_bootloader_mhc_config_system](GUID-ADE6D8EB-49F2-492E-9D4C-0A708A7F465E-low.png)

-   **Application Start Address \(Hex\):**

    -   Start address of the application which will programmed by bootloader

    -   This value is filled by bootloader when its loaded which is equal to the bootloader size. It can be modified as per user need

    -   This value will be used by bootloader to Jump to application at device reset


Note

-   For optimizing the code Bootloader component disables generation of default interrupt and exception files as shown below

-   Enabling these interrupts explicitly may still not work as bootloader uses custom startup file which has its own Interrupt table populating only the reset handler
