# Fail Safe Update Memory layout for CORTEX-M based MCUs

-   Supported for the devices which have a Dual Bank flash memory

-   Internal Flash memory is split into two equal banks. Special NVM Fuse setting **\(AFIRST\)** is used to identify which bank is mapped to NVM main address space after reset.

    -   Start address of **Active Bank** is always **start of Internal Flash memory**

    -   Start address of **Inactive Bank** is from mid of the Internal flash memory which can vary from device to device. Refer to respective Data sheets for details of Flash memory layout.

-   **Bootloader must be placed at start location of both banks**

-   The application code can be placed anywhere **after the bootloader end address** till **mid of flash**. The application start address should be **aligned to Erase Unit Size of the device**

-   As the Bootloader code requires the application start address to be mentioned at compile time, it should match in both the application and bootloader

-   Bootloader running from Active bank will program the new image in inactive bank

-   Bootloader is responsible to perform a bank swap and reset to run the new firmware programmed in Inactive bank
