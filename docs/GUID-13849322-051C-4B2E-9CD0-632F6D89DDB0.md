# How the CAN Bootloader library works

The CAN Bootloader firmware communicates with the embedded host device by using a predefined communication protocol.

The CAN Bootloader works in two different modes

**Basic Mode**

-   This mode is supported for all the devices

-   Resides from

    -   The starting location of the flash memory region for CORTEX-M based MCUs

-   The Bootloader performs flash erase/program/verify operations with the binary sent from host while in the firmware upgrade mode

    -   The binary sent is only of the application to be programmed

    -   Bootloader always performs flash operation from the address for \(bootloader or application\) binary sent from host

    -   The application can use the entire flash memory region starting from the end of bootloader space

-   Jumps to the application once verification is completed


**Fail Safe Update Mode**

-   This mode is supported for the devices which have a Dual Bank flash memory

-   Resides from the starting location of the flash memory region of both the banks on **CORTEX-M based MCUs**

-   The Bootloader performs flash erase/program/verify operations with the binary sent from host while in the firmware upgrade mode

    -   Bootloader can perform flash operation in either of the banks based on the address sent by the host application

    -   The application can use only the flash memory region of one bank.

-   Performs a bank swap and reset to run the application programmed in inactive bank once verification is completed or a normal reset to run the application in current bank based on command sent from host
