# I2C Bootloader

The I2C bootloader Library can be used to upgrade firmware on a target device without the need for an external programmer or debugger.

**Features**

-   Supported Only on CortexM0+ and CortexM4 based Devices

-   Uses Harmony 3 I2C PLIB to communicate resulting in **smaller bootloader size**

-   Supports Fail Safe update

-   Takes **Binary File** as input

-   Receives Binary from an **I2C Embedded Host Device**


**Running From SRAM \(For SAM Devices\)**

-   Has capability to self update as it is running from SRAM

-   At reset the bootloader Reset handler copies the entire bootloader firmware into SRAM from Start location and start executing from SRAM

-   Once the application is called from bootloader, applications startup code takes control over SRAM and starts executing

-   **I2C Event Processor Task:**

    -   This task is responsible for receiving data from Embedded Host through the I2C communication interface

    -   The task polls and processes the I2C events.

    -   Based on the event received it gives control to **I2C Master Write Request** or **I2C Master Read Request** functions

    -   This task is responsible for responding to the bootloader commands received

-   **I2C Master Write Request:**

    -   This function is responsible to handle any write requests coming from I2C master

    -   It processes the commands received and notifies the status to **I2C Event Process Task**

    -   If the command received is a Erase/Prgram/Verify command it gives control to the **Flash task**

-   **I2C Master Read Request:**

    -   This function is responsible to handle any read requests coming from I2C master

    -   It sends the current status to I2C master if the command received is **Read Status**

-   **Flash Task:**

    -   This task is responsible to Erase/Prgram/Verify the internal flash memory with data packet received

    -   The task uses the NVM peripheral library to perform the Unlock/Erase/Write Operations
