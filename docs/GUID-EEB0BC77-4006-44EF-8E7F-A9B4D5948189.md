# USB Device HID Bootloader

The USB Device HID bootloader Library can be used to upgrade firmware on a target device without the need for an external programmer or debugger.

**Features**

-   Supported on CORTEX-M and MIPS based MCUs

-   Uses Harmony 3 USB Device HID driver to communicate

-   Supports Live update

-   Takes **Normalized Hex File** as input

-   Uses **Unified Host application** to receive the hex file from Host PC

**The Bootloader framework is divided into 2 sub-systems**

-   **Bootloader Task:**

    -   Erases the Flash memory

    -   Programs the hex file records into Flash memory

    -   Computes a CRC check of the Application in Program Memory

    -   Jumps to the Application

    -   Calls the DataStream Task at end of its every state machine execution

    -   This Task routine takes an interface-agnostic approach to the actual communication medium

    -   **Runs in Cooperative mode with other tasks in the system**

-   **Datastream Task:**

    -   This Task implements the USB Device HID communication interface to the receive the hex file from the **Unified Host Application** running on Host PC

    -   This Task is called from Bootloader Task routine
